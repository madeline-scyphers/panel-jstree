# ‚ú® panel-jstree

panel-jstree is a wrapper python wrapper around the javascript library [jstree](https://www.jstree.com) for use in [panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/). This allows for JSON-like representations of tree data. One very useful implementation provided is a server-side file browser.

You can install and use the package as simple as.

```bash
pip install panel-jstree
```

```python
import panel as pn
from panel_jstree import FileTree

pn.Column(FileTree())
```

## üöÄ Get started in under a minute

```bash
pip install  panel-jstree
```

Run the examples

```bash
panel serve examples/*.py --show
```

Here are some of the examples. You can see a small FileTree app with a text field and controls to directly input a file path, and turn off and on some of the controls.

You can also see a generic Tree app with a custom callback to generate random nodes.
